RELIFE MANUAL TEST

Jasmine will be used to test the Angular routing, thus this manual test will focus on the remainder of the site's functionality.


I. Navigation

a) Does the navigation bar transition onto the screen when hovered over by mouse on a desktop size screen?
   - Yes/Pass

b) Does the background darken when the navigation bar transitions on screen?
   - Yes/Pass

c) Does the navigation bar transition off the screen when the mouse is removed from the area?
   - Yes/Pass

d) Does the background return to its original colour when the navigation bar returns to its start position?
   - Yes/Pass

e) Does the design of the navigation bar change when the screen is under a desktop size, as per Bootstrap's sizing for devices?
   - Yes/Pass

f) Does the functionality of the navigation bar change when the screen is under a desktop size, switching from an 'onhover'
   function to an 'onclick' function?
   - Yes/Pass

g) Does the navigation bar transition on and off screen in its smaller device version, like it does in its larger version?
   - Yes/Pass


II. Responsiveness

a) Do the pictures on the 'Home' page move under the text when the screen is at a tablet size?
   - Yes/Pass

b) Do the pictures on the 'Home' page disappear when the screen is at mobile size?
   - Yes/Pass

c) Do the sections of text on all pages act responsively by wrapping to avoid overflow?
   - Yes/Partial Pass
     - Note: Between the measurements of 768px and 784px, the text overflows from the container. Under 768px and everything wraps as
       it should. This is due to the padding on the left, but the padding is vital to the site. The issue only occurs for those
       16 pixels, which, after researching, appears to be due to a bug within Bootstrap. No attempted fixes have proved useful, so
       it may be a case that for that small 16 pixel window, there will have to be a very small horizontal scrollbar appear.
       Incredibly irritating, but the screen doesn't actually have to be scrolled to read all the content, which means it can be ignored by the user.

d) Does the Bootstrap 'accordion' behave responsively when viewed on all screen sizes?
   - Yes/Pass

e) Does the form on the 'Registration' page behave responsively on all screen sizes?
   - Yes/Pass

f) Does the modal on the 'Registration' page behave responsively on all screen sizes, avoiding overflow?
   - Yes/Pass


III. Form Control

a) Is the 'submit' button disabled until all required fields are completed?
   - Yes/Pass

b) Does the form submit and route to the 'Success' page when all requirements are met as per 'controller.js'. This includes having
   no checkboxes marked in the Health section, having the Citizenship marked as 'yes', and having the Criminal Record section marked
   as 'no'?
   - Yes/Pass

c) Does the form route to the 'Success' page when ANY of the checkboxes are marked in the Health section?
   - No/Pass

d) Does the form route to the 'Success' page when the Citizenship question is marked as 'no'?
   - No/Pass

e) Does the form route to the 'Success' page when the Criminal Record question is marked as 'yes'?
   - No/Pass

f) Does the form route to the 'Fail' page when ANY of the checkboxes are marked in the Health section?
   - Yes/Pass

g) Does the form route to the 'Fail' page when the Citizenship question is marked as 'no'?
   - Yes/Pass

h) Does the form route to the 'Fail' page when the Criminal Record question is marked as 'yes'?
   - Yes/Pass

i) Does the 'Zip/Post Code' field automatically change input to uppercase?
   - Yes/Pass



IV. Modal

a) Does the loading modal appear when the 'submit' button on the form is clicked?
   - Yes/Pass

b) Does the modal take five (5) seconds to route to either the 'Fail' or 'Success' page?
   - Yes/Pass

c) Does Angular insert the first name of the candidate as per the input entered in the 'First Name' field?
   - Yes/Pass

d) Does the modal create white-space for a non-existent vertical scrollbar on ANY screen size, as per the well documented
   Bootstrap bug for modals?
   - No/Pass
     - Note: This bug still exists in their code, but I rectified it using CSS

e) Does the modal's backdrop fail to close upon routing to 'Success' or 'Fail', thus crashing the site?
   - No/Pass
     - Note: This was rectified using jQuery

f) Does the routing to either 'Success' or 'Fail' still occur when the modal is closed using the close button?
   - Yes/Pass
